## Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cortney, a professional business analyst
[LinkedIn] [www.linkedin.com/in/cortney-williams-715163347]

Currently I am analyzing business data to identify trends and reduce high product return rates. My experience in analyzing problem trends and providing solutions to clients have helped me develop my problem solving, time-management, analytical, and communication skills. 
In 2024, I enrolled in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics program. The program covered data storage and processeing (SQL), data visualizations (Tableau), PowerBI and more. It also involved practical projects.

Some facts about me:
- I enjoy yoga, coffee, and a self-help books
- I love learning new and interesting things, especially fun facts about random subjects
- I enjoy finding and recreating healthier versions of me and my friends favorite snacks and meals
- I was a high school special education teacher for 3 years before deciding to switch careers

I am currently located in Greensboro, NC but I am willing to relocate.

Goals for 2025:
- Land my dream job in business analytics
- Finally understand investing
- Visit and explore 2 states outside of North Carolina
